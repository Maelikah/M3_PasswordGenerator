##   📝 Description


---

</br>


Password security is important because passwords are the first line of defense against cybercriminals and their unauthorized access to our personal data. Creating a strong and secure password can reduce the risk of cybercriminals guessing our passwords and accessing sensitive data.

The objective of this application is to allow a user to generate a secure random password based on different input criteria such as: 

- Password Length
- Character Types

This application uses several technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, being JavaScript the one used the most.
