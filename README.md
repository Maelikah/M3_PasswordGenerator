# Module 3 Challenge - Password Generator
Password Generation Challenge. The purpose is to create an application with javascript that will generate a random password based on input conditions

## Description


Password security is important because passwords are the first line of defense against cybercriminals and their unauthorized access to our personal data. Creating a strong and secure password can reduce the risk of cybercriminals guessing our passwords and accessing sensitive data.

The objective of this application is to allow a user to generate a secure random password based on different input criteria such as: 

- Password Length
- Character Types

This application uses several technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, being JavaScript the one used the most. 


## Installation

Installation not required, simply open up the **Password Generator** html file and click on the Generate Password button. Follow the on-screen instructions.

The webpage should be navigated and the following acceptance criteria should be tested and validated:

*	GIVEN I need a new, secure password
    *	WHEN I click the button to generate a password
        *	THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
    *	WHEN prompted for password criteria
        *	THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
    *	WHEN prompted for the length of the password
        *	THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
    *	WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
        *	THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
    *	WHEN I answer each prompt
        *	THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
    *	WHEN all prompts are answered
        *	THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
